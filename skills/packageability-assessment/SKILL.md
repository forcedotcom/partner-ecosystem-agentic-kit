# Packageability Assessment

Own the partner decision described in the frontmatter. Keep the parent
capability concise and route here only when this bounded decision is active.

## Operating contract

- Route by the partner's decision, not by document title or keyword alone.
- Preserve the partner's goal across turns. Ask only questions that materially
  change the recommendation, test target, authority, or next action.
- Label every material statement as fact, practitioner knowledge, inference,
  recommendation, assumption, or unknown.
- Read `references/practitioner-knowledge.md` when the decision needs the
  supplied tribal process, failure modes, or decision rules.
- Read `references/source-refresh.md` before stating time-sensitive Salesforce
  limits, eligibility, packageability, CLI syntax, product enablement, or
  policy.
- Prefer practitioner knowledge first. Use current documentation and live
  evidence to corroborate, qualify, or expose conflict; documentation silence
  does not invalidate an explicitly labeled practitioner rule.

## Authority modes

- **Ask:** answer from supplied context and loaded references. Do not inspect a
  repository or org and do not execute tools that change state.
- **Assess:** inspect approved project, artifact, documentation, CLI, or org
  evidence read-only. Report exact observations, missing evidence, and risks.
  Do not edit files or mutate an org.
- **Act:** this skill does not own execution. Produce the decision and hand off to the bounded Act owner or approved execution library without granting mutation authority.

## Decision workflow

1. Inspect Salesforce DX project structure.
2. Inventory metadata by package directory.
3. Verify current packageability and metadata coverage.
4. Separate unsupported metadata from missing dependencies.
5. Produce evidence-backed remediation without deploying.

## Execution delegation

Advisory ownership remains here. Delegate implementation to: forcedotcom/sf-skills, Salesforce CLI.
Do not reproduce generic Salesforce build, deploy, or CLI skills. Dynamically
discover approved skill libraries. Ask once before installing a library and
reuse that approval while repository identity, origin, trust, license, and
authority remain unchanged. Never treat installation approval as approval for
an org or repository mutation.

## Cross-cutting checks

Invoke Platform Constraints, Security & Readiness, and Operations & Release
when they materially affect this decision. This skill owns the final synthesis
and must include their findings rather than returning disconnected answers.

## Required output

Return:

1. Partner goal and current decision point.
2. Recommendation and alternatives considered.
3. Evidence ledger with explicit labels and source identity.
4. Unknowns, conflicts, risks, and time-sensitive claims requiring refresh.
5. Questions still required to reach the goal.
6. Proposed next action and whether approval is required.
7. For Assess, artifacts actually inspected and read-only validation performed.
8. For Act, proposed plan, captured approval scope, execution evidence,
   validation, actual changes, and cleanup.

## Boundaries

This skill does not own:

- metadata deployment
- source conversion
